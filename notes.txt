-BUG -Shooting doesn't apply any damage at all now for some reason.

-BUG -Error at line 1065 (cohension check) during player 2 charging action. It's a maximum call stack size exceeded so probably too many socket calls

-Have "players" as a dropdown menu with a minimum of 2 players to be selectable. Auto-select 2 players to start with

-Write in a check to clear live tiles drawn when the mode goes to a non moving action
    -Also clear the live tiles when a new unit is selected

-Maybe see what the live tile draw looks like if they're drawn while generating

-if a sides/start points aren't set properly, don't allow the game to advance


-see if different icons can be shown in the mini map rather than just reshow the map as-is

-Load up armies associated with users in army selection dropdowns

-test out a 3 side game
-test out a 2 side, 4 player game

-error socket messages need to be returned to the originating player only


-messages
    -Stop server messages that're specific to a user being sent out to everyone
    -Scroll the messages when the message box goes beyond it's max height

-DONE -Need to check the live tile drawing online when it's player 2's turn.

-DONE -Saving and reloading
    -DONE -When a game is reloaded and the next action is played, the button doesn't come back properly, only the text does
    -DONE -I think more than one player causes the game to be saved multiple times. Need to check and correct
    -DONE -When the game reloads, the non current player can now see buttons


-DONE -When the second player reenters the game they're seeing the action button when it should be hidden from them if it's not there turn

-DONE -When a game is left and restarted, the joining of the second player causes a line in the updateRoomInfo function in connFunction to error on line 306


-DONE -player_side isn't being saved. Because of this when a game is rejoined, a player side isn't set for the player to buttons aren't revealed properly again.
    -Set in the army selection step


-DONE -See if I can make the pathfinding process async

-DONE -players still being pulled into the same room when you don't want it
    -start a 2 playerm game, perform an action then both leaves
    -if a player then tries to start a new room with 1 player, the other player is pulled into that game


-DONE - There's far too much data being sent with the save function when it comes to unit data. Need to strip it down so memory isn't exhausted.

-DONE -Load Issues
    -DONE -Current side was incorrect. Which is probably linked to the "advance side" button
    -DONE -Buttons aren't showing
    -DONE -Mode is incorrect
    -DONE -Shot tallies aren't appearing properly once the game is reloaded

-DONE -if a player rejoins the game and are passed completed setup options, bypass the "select armies" screen and put them back into the game


-DONE -Fix issue where buttons aren't selectable on the top html bar once the game starts 
    -The issue is that the gameContainer element is covering the buttons


-DONE -Hide "create/join" bar once a player has created or joined a room

-DONE -For some reason the far right squad when 2 players are setup has 2 units that don't trigger paths being drawn
-DONE -Action button seems to be bugged again. Appearing for both sides on the live site and the button doesn't seem to become live again once the move action if complete for player 1.


-DONE -Make the draw live tiles method as efficient as possible using the current method
-DONE -Gray path is being set from future selected units instead of being from the original units origin point
-DONE -Make selecting a new conherancy based unit reset how coherancy is drawn for the previous squad i.e. don't have one unit selected in particular
-DONE -BUG - once a movement has been made, the unit elements don't move with their parent
-DONE -Put up a loading screen while the players actually load into the game rather than setting things to black

-DONE -run check at the end of movement to see if a unit is in combat range. If not, mark the unit as not being in combat range
-DONE -if a unit is in combat, skip and shot setting actions
-DONE -design larger map
-DONE -Have graphics and paths cleared if another action is selected. Also reset ghosts
-DONE -in_combat is still set to true after enemy dies
-DONE -create function automatically lay units out around a certain point
-DONE -Cohesion check doesn't work properly. It only checks that units are close to one other unit, so as long as a group are close to each other, even though they're away from their other squad, will still pass the cohesion check
-DONE -Fix the multiple press for movement bug
-DONE -Add in a delay for bullets being shot
-DONE -move the ghost when online, otherwise it doesn't register. In fact, don't have opponent ghosts generate if online
-DONE -stop a player from being able to interact with another players units
-DONE -Hide action buttons when it's not a players turn
-DONE -Need to make sure dead units are checked for cohesion checks
-DONE -Need to get the player, side and squad values properly saved and passed back when the game reloads
-DONE -Add a connection function to update side selection and army selection to all dropdowns
-DONE -Only allow the start button to show when sides and armies are selected for all players
-DONE -make the "advance mode" a connection method so it can update the button for all sides 
-DONE -Need to pass the assigned "side" of the player to the right player when the game starts. Currently it's being saved but not set on the client side.
-DONE -Need to make sure the wounding calculation result is passed to all players rather then have them all perform their own calculation and come up with different results.

-DONE -Players still can't end their turn
-nothing stops a player from placing more than 1 card down
-cards aren't snapping to the hand bar anymore
    -this only happens if the game is started by player 1 then player 2 enters.
    -The game gets confused about who should be controlling the "snap to hand" function
    -The snap to function isn't working on the second player screen when a card is drawn
-DONE -When a player rejoins a room, the game setup menus needs to be skipped




-Add in step to the socket util that checks for reconnections and automatically tries to rejoin room
-Maybe have it that if the author gets kicked out of the room, everyone is kicked out too?
-"request change player" doesn't do anything
-Add in a deck generator when the game starts (Needs to be on server)


CHARACTER SELECT
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
-When selections have been made on both sides, only player 1 can then end the selection and start the game



SERVER SOCKET FUNCTIONS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////



DECK
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

BUGS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

-There's no current way of limiting the number of players in the room
-Palming "max height" check doesn't work. Won't allow cards to be placed in bottom 2 rows of grid
-picking up card from scrollbar always ends up making the center point move upwards, making the card annoying to place

-DONE -Save game info (like lives) to DB

-DONE -Setting a password on a room doesn't have any effect at the moment
-DONE -When a player rejoins a room, it doesn't reload any of the assets that've already been placed in said room. Need to keep track of them
-DONE -Seems that when there's a second player added in this setup the drawn card doesn't snap into the hand bar on player 1's screen but does on the non-current player 2 screen.
	-There's a lot of oddities here as now the second player, when it joins room 1, doesn't have the ui generate

-DONE -Got the menu selection screen to appear which was a long standing problem
-DONE -modify the code so the character menu pops up in the regular game loop
-DONE -Make the selection update via sockets so both players can see who the other has selected
-DONE -Add in a more generic "request gamestate advance" to move the gamestate on when needed, like when the start game button is selected
-DONE -Need to fade the character screen on both sides as currently it doesn't

-DONE -Fix the "last card" not flashing when the game is rejoined
-DONE -Load card angle, orientation, position and load status

-DONE -when a player attempts to create a room:
    -Check to see if the room exists already
        -If the room belongs to the user
            -if the users socket belongs to the room, say they're already in it
            -else, say the room exists, the user just needs to rejoin room
        -Else send message to say "room name in use, choose another"

-DONE -when a player leaves the room:
    -Remove them from the socket list


-DONE -Have the rotate function calculate on the server and save the orientation onto the card list there

-DONE -Need to add in "card_arr_pos" to cards array on server
-DONE -Need to add "card orientation" to cards array

-DONE -When max player is set to 1 and the player leaves and reenters room, they can't draw any cards
	-DONE -The problem comes from the "room info" request appearing after the game "start message" so when the create card buttons are made, they don't set with the correct room info.	Fixed by assigning the adding the room name and id when the connection function is run, instead of pre-loading the values.
	
-DONE -Save drawn deck to game info in DB
-DONE -Save board layout to DB
-DONE -Pass room ID back to players to use later

-DONE -create a deck array (for drawing cards) and add it to the room model
-DONE -create a board matrix array and add it to the room model

-DONE -Have cards data on the server
	-DONE -Card X and Y pos
	-DONE -Card grid X and Y pos

-DONE -BUG -It's now difficult to get the card off of the scrollbar. It eventually can be pulled from it but only after the bar is revisited a number of times
	-The selected card function needs to be run as the card is moved, otherwise the "held" status is revoked

-DONE -update "update board matrix" function
-DONE -update "check board matrix" function

-DONE -Add tween for cards changing sizes
-DONE -Add tween for card rotation

-DONE -Drawing a card doesn't take a card from a deck, it's just a set value at the moment
-DONE -Set grid set function x and y positions on the server then pass it back.
-DONE -Replace instances of card_id where it's actually "cards_array_id" to make things clear

-DONE -Handle "check card lock" process on the server instead of the client
    -DONE -Need to have the following vars on the server:
        -DONE -last card
        -DONE -cards array
